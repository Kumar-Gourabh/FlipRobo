No heating issue for me,

2,5,"I did research on laptops for past 2 weeks and finally made the decision of getting myself Dell Inspiron 5408 series. Let's start with each points.

Looks : Premium design, diamond cut hand rest which gives it a classy finish. The backside is quite similar to the mac air which is also good.

Performance: I use them for content typing, editing, presentations, online conferences, mostly all of these at the same time. So, multi-tasking really works well with the i5 processor. The camera quality ..."

Also, I have read one review from a person who had ordered this laptop and was facing problem with audio jack. So, to that person and all of you I want to say that audio jack is in completely good condition you just need to update some drivers then it will works well.

5,2,"Audio jack is not working. Recieved defective product. And no option for replacement. Dell assured me that product need to be replaced but flipkart is not replacing the product and keeps on postponing the date of replacement.
Horrible experience of buying laptop from flipkart.
It's been more than 18 days and flipkart is keeping on expanding the date of replacement. Terrible customer support and worst experience."

Laptop takes time at boot but that's fine you can start laptop little bit early before your work. I bought HDD version cause it gives more storage than SSD. After the start laptop runs smoothly.

20,5,"It's a good laptop with no issue as such ! Screen is IPS good viewing angles ! Battery is decent 4-5hr easily!
Build quality is good previously i was using HP 14s i3 11th gen, the quality was poor, though it is a good laptop when it comes to performance.
The only issue is it's VRAM which is 512mb quite low !! You can't play GTA V in even 720p, which is possible in i3 11th gen which can play it in 1080p.
Rest it's a good piece of hardware."

Performance -: ryzen 3 4300U best processor you can get in this segment. AMD is destroying intel nowadays.

There is no backlit keyboard."
30,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...

35,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment.
If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for.

2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.

I loved this mobile,It was just like narzo 20 but the camera of narzo 20 was pretty good,it is a good phone at this price range but some changes can make this phone more better than now,like fhd+ display or a good camera setup but is quite still a pretty mobile.

Rest all features are okayish in all brands today like Mi, Oppo, Realme. I bought a Moto one action last year (128G) and cheaper than this but trust me Moto is better compare to this Oppo A53 in terms of app responsiveness and AI."

Pros:

Bigger display
Best battery backup ( at least 2 days)

Worst ram management
Worst cameras (pathetic in artificial light)

509,5,I have been using this watch for 10 days.This is better than most of the smart watches in the market currently.I am also using oppo watch.It has google os.I personally feel that galaxy watch's os(tizen) is better than google's(wear). It's user interface is very good.It's E sim is working very well.I can leave my mobile at home and can make and receive calls through this watch.I definitely recommend this watch over other watches.
510,5,"The Timeless design will instantly set u apart from others. Its a beautiful watch with all the basic activities. Main constraint is the battery which last approx 36 hours but apart from that every other aspect is 5 star.
The LTE set up with Jio was very smooth and can be easily configured using the Galaxy wearable app on the phone.
The display is vivid with true colors. Lots of watch faces available which makes it distinguishing and super stylish.
The speaker and microphone also does its job..."
511,5,You couldn‚Äôt get a better smart watch in this price segment. I own an Apple Watch LTE also. This however is recommended for day to day use. It‚Äôs a light weight watch and not too pricy for your pocket. It works! I got the Aluminium LTE variant on Flipkart during sale.
512,5,"Bought it for 16500. LTE aluminium version. So I felt its worth. Somehow I didn't research much abt LTE functionality with airtel. Surprisingly LTE standalone will work only with airtel postpaid sim itseems. Only jio will work with prepaid & postpaid itseems. So I don't want to switch to postpaid airtel.. hence am not able to use its entire feature. But Bluetooth calling works fine in prepaid airtel.
I'm yet to observe its pros & cons yet. Will update the review after a couple of month!"
513,4,"Samsung smartwatch is undoubtedly one of the best in the market , but disappointed with it ,as few essential features are missing
Firstly they should introduce fast charging option for their smartwatch which is very much essential feature these days
Secondly Oxygen saturation level SP02 is missing which need to be introduced soon , samsung should work on this as this is the need of the hour
Thirdly GPS should be inbuilt instead of buying it from app store
Fourthly Most of the good watch face..."
514,4,"So its been almost 2 weeks since I am using this watch. There are certain pros and cons of this watch which are as follows.

Pros :
1. The look and feel of the watch is pretty nice. It has some very good variety of watch faces also which can very well embellish the watch.

2. Support of considerable ammount of third party apps which are more than fitbit but slightly less than Apple watch.

643,5,"Really good monitor at this price range and it's IPS with good viewing angles and the most important one is it's 75hz free sync with HDMI. I like it's color production, if you r low on budget go for it it's definitely worth it....."
644,4,"Good. Value for money monitor. Nice ips panel, bright and rich colours. It has AMD sync feature and multiple colour and contrast settings.

Improvement needed. The base is very old fashioned and extremely light and not struddy. But there is wall mount option. No height adjustment. If they would haven given speakers as in some other Acer monitors it would have been good to connect fire TV stick directly and watch."

650,5,The product was great I am loving it and it's working properly and nice packaging nice monitor
651,4,Happy With the quick delivery of flipkart. But the actual resolution of the monitor is 1366 x 768 not 1600 x 900 as written on the description.so beware of that. And the other thing. I only got this product today so I can't say more about this monitor. But I can say one thing for sure this monitor is pretty much satisfactory for its cost. Maybe I will re-edit this review after using this product for some days.
652,5,Amazing work good quality display mind-blowing super fast delivery
653,3,"I am little bit angry. This is LCD Monitor not HD + LED described by your heading line.

The product quantity:
The Acer monitor is a good quality monitor. I am satisfied with the product. It is running fine till date. It is promptly delivered as described in the Flipkart. I say my sincere thanks to Acer Team and Flipkart team."
655,4,"Ok, good product but not same as said. It is a hd display not a hd+ display. They also don't gave me screw to mount it to wall.But the best thing is the hdmi port. I personally love it. 1 year onsite warranty and 2 year maintainance warranty."
656,5,"Although the monitor is great, and very vibrant, I would like to suggest the seller to change the product detail as this monitor only support vga and hdmi input and not dvi as shown in pictures, and another thing, the mac resolution is 1344 x 728 and not 1600 x 900 as mentioned on the details page. Other than that, it's a very good monitor with a little wider fov."
657,4,perfect one ...but sound quality is not so good enough but can manage to hear a low audible voice well in this price it's an awesome gives flowless 60 Hz well if can manage to go a 2k would recommend ips screen those who are buying for gaming would be satisfied but would enjoy the gaming feeling well for using with setup box it's nice it's has HDMI VGA and 1 in and out 3.5mm jack
658,5,The monitor was pretty awesome after upgrading from a 60hz monitor to a 165hz . I tried csgo and valorant it was a pretty huge difference you can also feel the smoothness and the colour contrast was awesome as it has a IPS panel quite awesome deal it is
659,5,I don't know much as i used to have a 17 inch and 60 hz monitor but after buying this it feels like i have the smoothest PC in the world (i know there are better monitors and stuff but pretty good for a gamer ) but the speakers is kind of useless its sooo low in volume
660,5,Excellent monitor! Made my games look so smooth without a graphic card! I am currently using Ryzen 3400G APU and with the freesync enabled it works perfect! And another feature is it's speakers which are usually not available in this segment. They sound great!
661,5,"Very good monitor. Next day delivery. Its almost bezel less on the sides. Very premium with brushed finish on the back. I can even set 4k resolution at 60fps, however 165fps is for 1080p. Good solid buy @ 10.5k price."
662,5,"I have upgraded from aoc 60 hz TN monitor to acer nitro 165hz ips monitor which gives a huge difference. Through hdmi am getting 144hz refresh rate , to get full 165 hz use dp cable . Overall fabulous monitor!!"
663,5,"Updated model of Vg240p.

Pros : better refresh rate(144->165hz)
VRB is helpful to reduce motion blur, good colour reproduction, speakers added, Dp cable added.


Cons : plain moniter stand, you can't adjust the height and you will have problem placing moniter close to you due to V shaped stand that might get in way for Mouse/keyboard

689,4,"Let's start with real world performance. The monitor looks chic and the slim bezels wows. The brightness is adequate and colours pop decently. The image is pretty sharp too.

706,1,Just 10 days display shows lining very disappointed.
707,5,Great monitor with a great price. Highly recommended.
708,4,"A must have for people who work on coding or your office work. You can have the screen tilted in any direction you like. You can get other monitors for cheaper price but make sure you get a stand like this.

The downside the cables which comes along with it are of no use. You won't be able to make it work with you laptop. I have a z book which has almost all the connectors available but the cables which comes along with this monitor doesn't work at all."

Cons (nitpicking ofcourse)

No HDMI cable included
No included speakers"
710,4,Nice Product. Suitable for work from home. It does not have HDMI Cable in the package. We need to buy it as a separate one. But overall nice monitor for Work From Home with good budget
711,5,"Really good quality product. But remember, you have to Calibrate it at the beginning, which is pretty easy too! Awesome build quality. Colour, Saturation & Sharpness is just the perfect!

Important Note: If connected over HDMI, change the default 'RGB' mode to 'YCbCr' to achieve an accurate blackness of the screen, resulting in to perfect Saturation."

716,1,"Guys please don't buy from ZRPL. They are the worst seller's. Please avoid purchasing from this seller.
They provided very big 3pin connector which is generally used for heater and heavy duty works. I have seen other dell monitors but they dont have this much big 3pin connector.
Sometimes buttons are not working. Pixel color correction are not proper."
717,5,Very impressive
718,5,The monitor is aesthetically very pleasing with minimum bezzel around the sides except the bottom. The display quality is very good and the colours are fairly accurate. The monitor can be tilted as per liking and has a sturdy base. The monitor is best suited for office and home use with general computing works. It has speakers but they are very tiny and not useful but it has audio output for attaching external speakers.
719,5,"It's been a month, i m using the monitor, its working very well, the IPS panel is really nice, viewing angles, colour, sharpness everything is good. Reading, browsing, watching YouTube videos can be done smoothly. Speaker volume is too low but i don't really need them.
What i didn't like about the monitor is that it takes almost 5 seconds to turn on.
Other than that its amazing so i'm rating 5 starts wanted to rate 4.75 but there's no option, so 5 it is."
720,5,Good Colors. Value For Money Product.
721,1,Nowhere in the description or on the box it mentions that 16A sized 3pin cable is included with monitor. That size is used for Fridge/Microwave etc and doesn't fit in a regular 3 pin socket. Can not use this monitor without buying a convertor now. Highly disappointing that this is not mentioned in any of the product details.
722,5,fabulous product
723,4,Good
724,4,"After using for one day, I can say this monitor is fine but you have purchase a 6 Amp power cable seperately around Rs120, because the power pable provided with the is of 16Amp which does not fit the switch board."

PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS AUSTRALIAN IMPORT SO NO INDIAN POWER CABLE.........................."
729,4,"The monitor was worth an investment. The display is nice and the screen area cover is good too. I am yet to discover all the display features but the options of brightness to be set for reading, net surfing, etc is a good one.

From my perspective this is okay for both entertainment & working purpose at this price range. It looks sturdy & I am satisfied with build quality also. I have picked this after exploring many monitors at this price range and moreover I have HP laptop which makes to prioritize this. Thanks."
758,3,"Good entry level gaming monitor, Using it about a month now, recommended for those who love fps games.The description is Wrong its not an ips panel its a TN panel check asus website for accurate details. IPS will never achieve a 1ms response time, also 16ms is the min possible response time acheievd on a 60hz display. Visual quality is not good as an IPS panel display you will need to tweak the display for best colours and quality"
759,5,"A fairly good Monitor at this price range!!
but if you are buying it to play fps game then go for something smaller like a 19.5 inch screen 900p resolution monitor!
this is super good everything is great. but as i was a 14.5"" monitor user before this one. i am having difficulties playing csgo on this. but with time i'll get use to it!!
overall a great deal and best monitor in under 10k range"
760,5,"Amazing product with 1 ms response time. It has a decent speaker as well. Its pretty good tbh. For those who are saying no speaker they just dont know how to set it up. Use either a HDMI cable or the 3.5mm cable(which is provided in the box) for audio.
No HDMI cable provided in the box tho. The viewing angles are pretty good for something without an ips display. The only thing is that its 60hz refresh rate and not 75.

And for ur info i bought this during big billion days for lesser price...."

Good monitor for office work and 1080p gaming. Amd free sync ability helps go 75Hz without vsync. Colors could be better, though. And the dynamic contrast ratio is more pain than pleasure.

Bezels are not as narrow as it seems. The rim is definitely narrow and the glass big, but when on you will notice gaps around the screen on the edges, under glass.

No bundled driver. Default drivers work fine but if you want a bit more functionality use the online driver/controller ..."

This is va type that suited my need"
793,4,Using as an external screen for my laptop for past one month. I have no complaints after use.Attaching the base to the monitor can be a little tricky.
794,5,"This is my honest review
Don't hesitate in buying this go for it
Only con is that there no speakers but overall the display is vibrant no issues

Good for the price üôÇ"
795,5,"Great product by lenovo in this price, loved it.."
796,5,"I bought this monitor after so much research of finding the best 24 inch IPS monitor. Here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
IPS screen provides better colour accuracy & wider viewing angle
3 side borderless screen provides that extra diagonal screen width unlike other monitors which provide 23.8 inch only instead of 24.
Better picture modes for different needs(Gaming, Cinema, Photo Editing etc)
Good refresh rate of 60 hz or 75 Hz with AMD freesync
Good Response time of 5ms


Cons:
Like every IP..."
797,5,"A definite upgrade over the popular 22mp68vq. For a price of 11k, choosing this over that is a no-brainer! 75hz refresh rate supported natively as well over HDMI. 24 inch is perfect size for a 1080p display, so I am glad this isn't smaller or bigger. PERFECT!"
798,5,"Exactly as i hoped it to be, deeper dark and brighter whites , decent picture quality, less bright though, but nice to watch movies in less illuminated room, don't get bothered about the ips glow (pretty much acceptable ), all in all best budget ips 75 Hz monitor with freesync."
799,5,"Bought it for WFH. It's an amazing purchase. The colours are good, bezels are thin (only 3 sides). And the joystick is fun to operate. There is a reader mode in the monitor which blocks blue light. Also it's probably not mentioned here, but vertical angle adjustment is possible.
Only thing which took me by surprise is.. The back portion is white coloured which is not obvious from the images shown here. I was fine so kept it."
800,5,It serves my daily needs as I am not a hardcore gamer and LG has its own software for on screen control. You need to download the latest version from LG's website. HDMI cable is included. And the picture looks superb as the monitor is connected with my Gigabyte Raedon RX570 4 GB GPU. Bezel less design adds spices to the picture when you are watching movies or play games. The software will give you the freedom to choose pre defined picture mode or you can create your own. Depth of Black is ver...
801,5,"Really best panel good viewing angle loved it LG is best (Gaming, Editing, Etc ) best."
802,4,"Very Good buy, got it for 10400. Has read mode which is very useful during programming. Only drawback is that it doesn't have usb ports. Only 2 hdmi 1 vga and aux out. If you just need a very good hd 24 inch display and ready to connect to external speakers then go for this."
803,5,"This IPS-technology monitor meets my needs exactly. It has nice borderless design, awesome viewing angel, Radeon free sync. On-screen control is very easy and useful features."
804,5,"A real gem with 24"" screen within this budget with 75Hz screen refresh rate. It's buttery smooth in gaming and during normal work as well. It can be recommended to any type of user, without any doubt."
805,5,just buy it but it is not 4k u can't play 4k video/movie in it and u Don't get 4k in 24inch u have go below 18inch or from 27inch.not good for front eye user. use it from little far ok... overall best for price.
806,4,"Disclaimer : Photo misleading , bezel not as thin as shown. They're about 0.7-0.8 cms , live every other monitor. Nothing special.

That aside, this is one beautiful monitor. Stand looks sleek and modern. Feels sturdy with minimal wobble. Although it does lift the display up from the desk an inch higher than most monitors.

Has VESA mount behind the stand socket, so can be mounted on an arm or the wall.

Sadly, no height adjustment. But angle can be adjusted.

Colours look clear. There is som..."
807,3,"Fast 1Day delivery by ekart.
Picture quality very good.
Base stand and packing all godd. HDMi given no VGA cable given inside box.
Not sure how to mount on the wall there seems no holes for the same.

But....big big CON
Why even there is a speaker which is good for nothing.

Go for other varient without speaker save 2K.

Cutting 2 star for 2 3 W speakers which seems .5watt
Edit will be done after 1 month usage."
808,4,"Nice 250nits display !! Ergonomics was fascinating little over priced but comparatively good for productivity because it's only 75hz panel not good enough for gaming , suits for multi tasker like content creator or developer"
809,5,"This is one gorgeous piece of hardware that‚Äôs bound to elevate just about any desktop system out there. I noticed a slight bit of backlight bleeding during testing but it‚Äôs not really noticeable unless you‚Äôre actively looking for it. The display covers 99% of the sRGB space and I was happy with the calibration out of the box. The pixel density is a bit lesser than I‚Äôd like but unless Lenovo decides to build an Q22i I‚Äôm more than happy to stick with this one.

The stand is solidly heavy and ke..."
810,4,"The monitor is absolutely stunning. Colors are vibrant and the design of the monitor is eye-catching and premium. Whether it is playing AAA games or watching movies in FHD, the monitor is perfect. I have disabled the sound from the monitor as is not required in my case, however it is better than a laptop. You get 75 hz refresh rate and 4 ms response time as promised. However I have deducted 1 star as the bezel is not as thin as the one in the product ad here. It's slightly noticeable. I was ..."
811,5,Awesome quality and love the sleekness of Lenovo product.
812,4,"It's a good monitor, worth the buy and worth the price."
813,5,Good product go for it.

815,5,Best monitor for work and entertainment
816,5,"LG 22MP68VQ.
This monitor very good .
My personal experience .
Videos performs good quality .
And this morning looking good.
I have not gaming experience share.
Because, My lower PC , I have not trying to games and HDMI port.
So, I think, this is a best budget monitor.

That's all."
817,5,Perfect Monitor cum TV for me. Full HD clarity display. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable Full HD LED Monitor. Actually I have connected Airtel Digital TV and enjoying awesome video experience.
818,5,"This is my first ever 1080p IPS monitor. The display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. Out of the box it's at 60Hz unless you turn on freesync. You can unlock the 75Hz even on Nvidia graphics cards, except it won't support the AMD freesync technology. You get an HDMI cable out of the box too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page.
Please do note that you can't enter BIOS while having the freesync op..."
819,5,"Fabulous Purchase
I am Writing this review after 10 Days of Purchase!!!
And Believe it or not
I don't think presently under 10000 price segment any other monitor can c compete with this. This monitor is absolutely awesome. IPS LED bezel-less display 5 millisecond response time, cable manager, with great viewing angles, awesome colours.
If You are looking for a budget big screen monitor so you can choose it without any doubt.
I have purchased many monitors import segments higher prices and lo..."
820,5,"22MP68VQ and 22MK600M both have same specification except 3 spec

1. 22MP68VQ IS 2016 MODEL BUT 22MK600M IS 2018 MODEL and the Manufacturing date may vary in both the models
2. 22MP68VQ has VGA, DVI, HDMI and audio out ports - 22MK600M has VGA, 2 HDMI and audio out ports

3. MOST IMPORTANT IS DISPLAY (Panel Bit depth)
22MP68VQ is 8 bits panel and 22MK600M is 8 bits (6 bits + FRC) which is low quality and low cost display than 8 Bits panel.
6 Bits + FRC panel is a 6 bits panel and it try to ..."

823,5,"Writing this review after using it for 2months it is best in its price segment just go for it.. Dont think too much just buy it I'm saying this cuz I've searched for around 1 month or so. Then i finally made my mind to buy this monitor. If it helps, press like button so that others can also read my comment."
824,5,"I brought this monitor for 7200rs with bank offer.
Excellent monitor for the price tag.
It comes with AMD freesync.
I haven't tested this monitor with games, but perfect for browsing and video or movie.
Pros:
1. Thin bezels for 3 sides.
2. 3 connectors HDMI, DVI,VGA
3. 75 Hz refresh rate regardless of your gpu, just turn on freesync from monitor setting.
4. Black stabilizer works perfectly well.
5. Sharper image and video quality due to higher Pixel density when compared to 24 inch.
6. HDMI ..."
825,5,"Best monitor .but you have to lower down the brightness otherwise it will effect your eyes.
Delivery was fast but the packing was worst no protection was given just came in a tight cardboard box nothing else not even a bubble wrap . And if anyone reading this review knows how to run the monitor in 75 hz please reply because even after turning off the freesync there is no option to switch from 60hz to 75hz ...This monitor can only achive upto 73hz with overclocking but it can decrease the lon..."
826,4,If video is Full HD or 2K then this monitor works like a charm otherwise video appears distorted. My HP IPS panel in same price range has better clarity and colour reproduction but only difference is audio out which is available in this monitor.
827,5,"This monitor is with two hdmi port which helps to connect two devices you can switch easily between two ports, the out is just awesome worth for money. Special discount from Flipkart on discount sale kudos to Flipkart for offer
One draw back no speaker with it rest worth"
828,5,Awesome monitor.... loving its eye care feature... using it currently in my dual monitor setup....
829,4,Awesome product.
830,5,Value for money monitor for WFH people. VGA ccable is given in box. Only cons for me was the 16A power adapter for which I had to buy a conversion board
831,5,GOOD PRODUCT
832,5,Received in good condition and working as expected. No issues to report in last one week of usage
833,3,"Big 16 amp of power cord is provided
No hdmi cable provided.

I would suggest to buy GW2480 instead of this as it comes with speaker and other two which I have mentioned above."
834,3,Not Ideal To use With 15.6 inch Laptop.. I went with 21.5inch insted and satisfied with it. also 16A Plus Is OverKill. also No Hdmi cable in box
835,5,"Design - 5/5
Quality - 5/5
Picture quality : 5/5

Note : 16W adapter will be provided and no hdmi will be there"
836,3,"Price got reduced by 1000 by the time my order was delivered. Is it possible to return the product and order the new one with cheaper price!

The base of the stand delivered to me looks to have a very minor scratch like it was already used. And a screw on the back side of the monitor looked loosened and worn out. I tightened it up to insert the stand. Hope the product is fresh and not the used one. Product is good and this review is for seller."

842,1,I did all settings.. but still I see it is creating lot of stress to the eyes.. I see the display not suitable for someone who spends 8 to 9 hours in day with computers
843,4,"Hey it's TN Panel not led or TFT OR Lcd panel
TN pannels are old model
This monitor released in 2015
If you watch movies and playing games don't go because it's not wide monitor
Still worth to buy because it has usb HDMI VGA ports in this monitor"
